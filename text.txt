The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
She sells seashells by the seashore.
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
All that glitters is not gold.
The early bird catches the worm.
Practice makes perfect.
Actions speak louder than words.
Better late than never.
